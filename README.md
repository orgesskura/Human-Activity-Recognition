# Human-Activity-Recognition
Repository for PDIoT course( Principles and design of IoT Systems). The aim of this project is to classify human acitivities( Sitting/Standing, Walking, Running, Lying, and Falling) using sensors (Respeck and Thingie) that are mounted on the person.

This repository contains the scripts used to train , validate , and test the models , the apk which you can use to build and use the application on your phone, and the reports for the application and model. It also incudes the tflite model. To validate our model, we used Leave One Cross Validation and achieved an accuracy of 96%. Our model was tested on unseen data and achieved 98% accuracy.
