# Human-Activity-Recognition
Repository for PDIoT course( Principles and design of IoT Systems). The aim of this project is to classify human acitivities( Sitting/Standing, Walking, Running, Lying, and Falling) using sensors (Respeck and Thingie) that are mounted on the person. I was part of a group of 3 people and we developed an application on which we could record what activity each person was doing and save that data for future use. It also had a login system. I was mostly responsible for pre-processing the data and building the CNN(convolutional neural network) that classifies the activities. The data was collected from all the students of the course who posted the data on a public repo. 

This repository contains the scripts used to train , validate , and test the models , the apk which you can use to build and use the application on your phone, and the reports for the application and model. It also incudes the tflite model. To validate our model, we used Leave One Cross Validation and achieved an accuracy of 96%. Our model was tested on unseen data and achieved 98% accuracy.
